🧠 Dominate the AI CTF Arena — Neurogrid CTF: Human-Only

A structured learning and write-up repository for mastering the Hack The Box Neurogrid CTF (Human-Only) challenge through manual analysis, AI security thinking, and real penetration testing methodology.

🚀 Project Overview

This repository documents my hands-on journey through the Neurogrid CTF: Human-Only challenge on Hack The Box. The focus is strictly on human-driven offensive security techniques, avoiding automated AI exploitation and emphasizing:

Manual reconnaissance

Logical exploitation paths

AI system attack surface analysis

Real-world pentesting mindset

Reproducible methodology

The goal is to build strong foundations in AI security and modern CTF problem solving.

🎯 Objectives

Understand AI-integrated attack surfaces

Practice structured CTF methodology

Improve enumeration discipline

Develop human-only exploitation skills

Build reusable pentesting workflows

Document lessons learned for future AI security work
